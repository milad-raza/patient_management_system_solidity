Patient data is vulnerable to thefts, compromise, and even unethical and unauthorized selling, and there have been many cases where the insurance companies and medical institutions have unethically used this data. 

Also, there have been cases of identity thefts and using data of dead patients to impersonate someone or for illegal activities, such as loan frauds, insurance frauds, and illegal identity usage.
